# Student Management System ðŸ“š

A Java-based console application that allows users to *add, edit, remove, search, and display* student records.  
Data is stored persistently in a file using *Java Serialization*, so student records remain even after restarting the program.

---

## Features
- *Add Student* â€” Add a new student with name, roll number, and grade.
- *Edit Student* â€” Update name and/or grade of an existing student.
- *Remove Student* â€” Delete a student record by roll number.
- *Search Student* â€” Find a student by roll number.
- *Display All Students* â€” Show all stored student records.
- *Persistent Storage* â€” Student data is saved to a file (students.dat) using serialization.

---

## File Handling
- Uses ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream to *save* and *load* data.
- Data is stored in the students.dat file in the program's directory.
